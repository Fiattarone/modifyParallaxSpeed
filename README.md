Hi,

Made this for my shmup, but maybe it can be used for other things

Simply drop this whole file into your plugins folder and drop the Modify Parallax Speed _CONDITIONALLY_ into your script. If you put this into a scene directly without conditions, it will be the same as just setting the parallax settings, which would be redundant.

Oh, layer 3 probably doesn't actually do anything. If anybody wants to tinker around with the code to make that function well, be my guest and submit a PR. Collabs welcome.

I have more plugins in the works also, so please reach out.

And obviously you know my gh

The future is retro my fellas, don't forget that!
